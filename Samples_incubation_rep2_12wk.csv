"for rep2 of the experiment, I used 5g soil and 250 ml of water for vortex because there was a big aggregate I can’t break up – it turned out to be a rock, and the soil has a lot of particulate this time, like pieces of chars and little sticks, I added all the soil solution into the inoculant in the end",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also filtered twice just in case some particles might leak from the top edge of the filter paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
